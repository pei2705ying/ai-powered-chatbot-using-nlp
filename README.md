# AI-Powered Chatbot Using NLP

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered chatbot** designed to answer **elementary and middle school scientific inquiries** through natural language conversations. It utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** like **TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity** to match user queries with relevant answers from a pre-defined dataset.

## Features
- âœ… **Intent Classification** â€“ Categorizes user queries into predefined intents (e.g., factual questions, small talk).
- âœ… **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** â€“ Uses tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal for query processing.
- âœ… **TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity** â€“ Computes similarity between user queries and stored responses to find the best match.
- âœ… **Identity Management** â€“ Recognizes and stores user names for personalized conversations.
- âœ… **Small Talk Integration** â€“ Enhances the chatbotâ€™s human-like interaction with casual conversations.
- âœ… **Typo Correction** â€“ Handles minor spelling mistakes to improve response accuracy.

## Technology Stack
- **Python** â€“ Core programming language
- **NLTK** â€“ Used for NLP pre-processing
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Implements TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity
- **Pandas** â€“ For data handling and analysis

## Usage
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Run main.py.

## How It Works
1. **Preprocess User Input**
   - Tokenization: Breaks sentences into words
   - Lemmatization: Converts words to base forms
   - Stop-word Removal: Eliminates unnecessary words

2. **Compute Query Similarity**
   - Converts processed text into a **TF-IDF vector**
   - Uses **Cosine Similarity** to find the closest match

3. **Generate a Response**
   - Returns the **most relevant answer** from the knowledge base
   - If no strong match is found, the chatbot asks for clarification

## Usage
```
# Run the chatbot
python main.py
```
Then, start interacting with the chatbot by typing your questions!

## Evaluation & Performance
The chatbot was tested with:
- âœ… **Factual questions** â€“ **80% accuracy**
- âœ… **Modified queries** â€“ **100% accuracy**
- âœ… **Small talk responses** â€“ **100% accuracy**
- âœ… **Modified small talk** â€“ **80% accuracy**

## Challenges & Future Improvements
- ðŸ”¸ **Handling complex NLP syntax** â€“ Variations in question phrasing may impact accuracy.
- ðŸ”¸ **Bias in dataset** â€“ Trained primarily with US English, leading to potential inconsistencies for UK English users.
- ðŸ”¸ **Enhancing semantic understanding** â€“ Improving response matching beyond keyword similarity using **word embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT).

## Potential Impact
This chatbot can evolve into a **fact-based AI assistant** capable of retrieving and verifying data more efficiently than traditional search engines.
